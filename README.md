ddns-daemon
===========

A Simple DynamicDNS Daemon using Node.js and Route53

## Usage 

Run your own

```
npm install -g ddns-daemon
```

Run on Heroku

```
git clone *this-repo*
heroku apps:create *your-app-name*
# this should add remote: "heroku git@heroku.com:*your-app-name*.git"
git push heroku
```

## Environment Variables

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (Required)
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (Required)
* `PASSWORD` (Optional)
* `PORT` (Optional *defaults to `3000`*)

*Tip: `heroku config:set --app your-app-name PASSWORD=sup3rt0ps3cr3t`*

## API

If `PASSWORD` is defined, it must be included in the URL

* `/<PASSWORD>/<[SUB]DOMAIN>/<IP-ADDRESS>` - Creates or updates this domain or subdomain with the given IP address (defines an A record)
* `/<PASSWORD>/show/version` - Shows `ddns-daemon` version
* `/<PASSWORD>/show/logs` - Shows primitive web logs
* `/<PASSWORD>/show/records` - Shows all records in all zones

### Notes

* In order for your router to consume this API, you'll need to use a custom URL as the Dynamic DNS service. I'm currently using the open source [TomatoUSB](http://tomatousb.org/) firmware. Otherwise, you could run a script on a *host* inside your network which periodically checks [your public IP](http://canihazip.com/s) and fires off an update when required.
* Domains are about $3.00/yr and then managing these on AWS Route53 is about $0.50each/mth
* Free heroku instances may be brought down due to innactivity, to keep them up - use [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/)
* Free heroku instances are not secured, so requests would be vuln to a MitM
* Logs get wiped on app restart
* AWS Route53 Docs can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Route53.html)

### Todo

* Allow this to run in real OS daemon mode on system start and function as the *host* described above
